# Fake_Profile_Detection

In this project, we came up with a framework with which the automatic identification of fake profiles is possible and efficient. This framework uses classification techniques like Random Forest Classifier to classify the profiles into fake or genuine classes. As this is an automatic detection method, it can be applied easily by online social networks that have millions of profiles whose profiles cannot be examined manually. Also, we will be comparing the result with another method of implementation that is already existing, i.e., SVM (Support Vector Machine).
